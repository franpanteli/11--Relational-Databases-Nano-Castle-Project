About this guided project:
	- This is a 40-lesson guided project 
	- This guided project builds castles in the terminal using Nano 
	- We are using a text editor in the terminal 

To complete the guided project:
	- Copy the project boilerplate code in a Gitpod environment 
	- Open the command palette (command, shift, p)
	- CodeRoad: Start
	- Complete the guided project 

Saving progress: 
	- You have to complete all of the project progress in one go (without backing out of Gitpod)
		- Otherwise your progress might not be saved -> in which case you would have to redo it
