# Relational-Databases-Nano-Castle-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my eleventh project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-nano-by-building-a-castle/build-a-castle) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my Nano skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/11--Relational-Databases-Nano-Castle-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the eleventh of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Constructing a Castle With Nano
### Problem Solving
For this guided project, I had to complete 40 Nano lessons in a Gitpod environment. A shell file was produced for this ([castle.sh](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Nano-Castle-Project/blob/main/castle.sh)), which contained a castle. This castle was produced and edited using Nano in a Bash terminal in 40 increments. Full notes on the task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Nano-Castle-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt), and comprehensive Nano notes from the castle 'construction' process are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Nano-Castle-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-nano-castle-project-course-notes.txt). These notes include instructions for running the project Bash file. 

### Project Output 
This is the contents of the project shell file:

```
echo "
Welcome to my castle
"

echo "
 /\                /\ 
/  \              /  \
